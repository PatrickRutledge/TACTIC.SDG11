Product Name: TACTIC.SDG11 Agent Engine

Overview: The TACTIC.SDG11 Agent Engine is a conversational AI engine that enables users to explore their perspectives on various topics, including Survival Situation and Digital Inclusion. The engine is designed to facilitate discussions, promote critical thinking, and provide users with options to engage in further exploration through Whiteboard, Debate, or Forum experiences.

Key Features:

Viewpoint Discovery Agent: The engine's primary agent, responsible for engaging users in discussions and determining their viewpoints on various topics.
Agent Handoff Mechanisms: The engine will enable seamless handoffs between agents, allowing users to transition between different experiences (Whiteboard, Debate, or Forum) based on their interests and preferences.
Whiteboard Agent: A specialized agent that creates visual maps of viewpoints for better understanding and exploration.
Debate Agent: A moderator agent that facilitates balanced discussions between differing perspectives, ensuring respectful and civil debates.
Forum Agent: A chairman agent that leads a simulated town hall meeting, allowing users to ask questions and engage with a panel of agents.
User Journey:

Initial Greeting: The Viewpoint Discovery Agent greets the user and introduces the topic of discussion.
Topic Selection: The user selects a topic to discuss, and the agent presents a series of questions to determine their viewpoint.
Viewpoint Analysis: The agent analyzes the user's responses and provides a summary of their viewpoint.
Options for Further Exploration: The agent offers the user options to engage in further exploration through Whiteboard, Debate, or Forum experiences.
Agent Handoff: The user selects an option, and the engine hands off the conversation to the corresponding agent (Whiteboard, Debate, or Forum).
Technical Requirements:

IBM Watson Orchestrate: The engine will be built on top of the IBM Watson Orchestrate platform, utilizing its conversational AI capabilities.
YAML Configuration: The engine will use YAML configuration files to define the agent's behavior, conversation flows, and handoff mechanisms.
WebChat Integration: The engine will be integrated with a static web app and WebChat to enable user interactions.
Reporting and Knowledge Graph:

Watson Discovery Agent: In the next phase, a Watson Discovery agent will be added to provide reporting capabilities and integrate with the engine.
Watson CloudPak Agent: A Watson CloudPak agent will be added to gather and fill a knowledge graph, enabling the engine to provide more accurate and informative responses.
Ideal YAML and Method for Agent Interaction:

To achieve the desired functionality, the YAML configuration files should define the following:

Agent Roles: Define the roles of each agent, including the Viewpoint Discovery Agent, Whiteboard Agent, Debate Agent, and Forum Agent.
Conversation Flows: Define the conversation flows for each agent, including the questions, responses, and handoff mechanisms.
Handoff Mechanisms: Define the handoff mechanisms between agents, ensuring seamless transitions between experiences.
Context Variables: Define context variables to store user responses, viewpoints, and other relevant information.
The method for agent interaction should involve the following:

Agent Initialization: Initialize each agent with its corresponding YAML configuration file.
Conversation Flow: Execute the conversation flow for each agent, using the defined questions, responses, and handoff mechanisms.
Handoff: Hand off the conversation to the corresponding agent based on the user's selection.
Context Management: Manage context variables to store user responses, viewpoints, and other relevant information.
By following this PRD, you can create a comprehensive and functional engine on Orchestrate that enables users to explore their perspectives on various topics and engage in further exploration through Whiteboard, Debate, or Forum experiences.
