# `@stepzen/fetch`

StepZen wrapper for the [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) npm package that implements the `fetch()` API for NodeJS.

The main reason to create this wrapper is create a workaround for an issue affecting a small part of StepZen CLI users where some CLI calls would stall due to an incorrectly terminated TCP transmission. See https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-cli/issues/934 for more details.

This package would be obsolete either when the ISP issue with TCP configuration is fixed, or when the CLI can assume it runs on NodeJS 19 or newer. In Node 19 the default http(s) agent config changes to add the `Connection: keep-alive` HTTP header, and that seems to prevent the issue.
