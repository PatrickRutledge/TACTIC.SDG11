# Viewpoint Explorer Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Viewpoint Explorer agent is designed to engage users in a discussion to determine their viewpoint on a particular topic. It serves as a gateway into the debate system, allowing users to understand their own position before seeing how others might debate the issue.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Agent Configuration (Completed)
- Created `viewpoint_explorer.yaml` with proper structure for Watson Orchestrate
- Added the agent to the debate system configuration in `debate_system_config.json`

### 2. Agent Functionality
- Determine whether we need to create specific Python code to support this agent
- If needed, create a `viewpoint_explorer.py` file to implement specialized functionality

### 3. Deployment Process
- Test deployment using the existing deployment script
- Verify that the agent is properly registered in the system

### 4. Testing Protocol
- Create a set of test topics and questions to evaluate agent performance
- Test the agent's ability to:
  * Engage in an initial conversation to understand the user's viewpoint
  * Ask probing questions that help clarify the user's position
  * Remain neutral and non-judgmental during the conversation
  * Offer a transition to either deeper exploration or a round-robin debate

### 5. Integration with Debate System
- Ensure the agent can properly hand off to a debate with multiple perspective agents
- Test the transition from viewpoint exploration to a structured debate

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Viewpoint Explorer agent** to test its basic functionality
2. **Evaluate the agent's performance** with a set of test questions
3. **Refine the agent's system prompt** based on testing results
4. **Develop the connection** between the Viewpoint Explorer and the debate system

## Deployment Command
```bash
cd /home/patrickrutledge/tactic.sdg11/adk-project
source venv/bin/activate
python debate_agents/deploy_debate_system.py
```

## Testing the Agent
After deployment, you can test the agent using:
```bash
cd /home/patrickrutledge/tactic.sdg11/adk-project
source venv/bin/activate
orchestrate chat start -a ViewpointExplorer
```

## Questions for Further Development
1. How should the agent determine when it has gathered enough information about a user's viewpoint?
2. What mechanism should be used to transition from the ViewpointExplorer to a full debate?
3. Should the agent store the user's viewpoint for future reference or analysis?
4. How can we measure the effectiveness of the agent in helping users clarify their thoughts?
