# TACTIC.SDG11 Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Setup and Configuration (Completed)
- [x] Initialize repository
- [x] Create basic agent YAML configurations
- [x] Set up development environment for Watson Orchestrate

## Phase 2: Agent Development (Current Focus)
- [ ] Refine ViewpointExplorer agent
  - [ ] Customize greeting
  - [ ] Implement conversation branches
  - [ ] Configure handoff mechanisms
- [ ] Develop WhiteboardAgent
  - [ ] Implement mind mapping functionality
  - [ ] Create visualization components
- [ ] Configure ModeratorAgent
  - [ ] Set up debate structure
  - [ ] Implement perspective switching
- [ ] Create Perspective Agents
  - [ ] Define progressive and conservative viewpoints for topics
  - [ ] Ensure coherent argumentation

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Test individual agent functionality
- [ ] Implement and test agent handoffs
- [ ] Debug path issues in configurations
- [ ] End-to-end testing of user journeys

## Phase 4: Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production Watson Orchestrate instance
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Prepare deployment guides
- [ ] Final verification and testing

## Current Tasks
1. Fix greeting messages across all agents
2. Resolve path issues in agent configurations
3. Test agent handoffs
4. Complete agent YAML configurations

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure context variables are properly passed between agents
- Verify that branching logic works correctly in ViewpointExplorer
- Document any limitations or edge cases in agent handoffs
