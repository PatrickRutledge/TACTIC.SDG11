# Watson Orchestrate Implementation Questions

## Questions for Watson:

I've created an optimized YAML configuration for my ViewpointExplorer agent based on your previous guidance. I have some specific questions about implementing this with Watson Orchestrate:

1. **Deployment Process**: What's the best way to deploy this new agent configuration? Should I update the existing ViewpointExplorer agent or create a new one?

2. **Context Variables**: I've included references like `{{ context.topic }}` and `{{ context.viewpoint }}` in my summary step. How exactly are these variables populated? Do I need to add specific code to capture user inputs into these variables?

3. **Testing and Debugging**: What's the recommended approach for testing this agent configuration? Are there any debugging tools or logs I can use to see if the steps are working as expected?

4. **Flow Control Optimization**: The current steps are mostly sequential. How can I implement branching logic if I want the conversation to go in different directions based on user responses?

5. **Error Handling**: What happens if a user skips answering a question or provides an unexpected response? Is there a way to handle error conditions in the steps?

6. **Performance Considerations**: Are there any performance implications or best practices to be aware of when using this approach with multiple steps?

7. **Extension Options**: How might I extend this agent in the future to integrate with other agents in my debate system? For example, could this agent hand off to other perspective agents for a round-robin debate?

Thank you for your guidance!
