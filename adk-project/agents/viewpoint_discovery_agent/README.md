# Viewpoint Discovery Agent

## Overview

The Viewpoint Discovery Agent is a conversational AI agent designed to help users explore and articulate their viewpoints on various topics. It facilitates a structured conversation that helps users better understand their own perspectives, consider alternative viewpoints, and engage with complex topics in a more nuanced way.

## Implementation Components

The agent implementation consists of two key files:

1. **`viewpoint_discovery_agent.yaml`**: The YAML configuration file that defines the conversation flow, including:
   - Context variables
   - Conversation steps
   - User interaction patterns
   - Response templates
   - Handoff mechanisms

2. **`viewpoint_discovery_agent.py`**: The Python implementation that handles the business logic, including:
   - Handler methods for conversation steps
   - Error handling and validation
   - Context management
   - Analytics and logging

## Key Features

- **Topic Selection**: Helps users identify a topic they want to explore
- **Viewpoint Articulation**: Guides users in expressing their viewpoint
- **Evidence Collection**: Prompts users to provide supporting evidence
- **Perspective Exploration**: Enables users to consider alternative perspectives
- **Counterargument Consideration**: Encourages users to think about potential challenges to their viewpoint
- **Summary Generation**: Provides a cohesive summary of the user's viewpoint

## Conversation Flow

1. **Introduction**: Agent introduces itself and explains its purpose
2. **Topic Selection**: User selects a topic to explore
3. **Initial Viewpoint**: User shares their initial perspective on the topic
4. **Evidence Collection**: User provides supporting evidence or examples
5. **Perspective Exploration**: User explores the topic from alternative perspectives
6. **Summary**: Agent summarizes the user's viewpoint and insights gained
7. **Next Steps**: Agent suggests further exploration options

## Implementation Notes

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom exception classes and graceful fallbacks
- **Method Organization**: Decomposed large handlers into smaller, focused helper methods
- **Documentation**: Detailed docstrings and implementation notes
- **Analytics**: Built-in event tracking for conversation analytics

## Getting Started

To use this agent with IBM Watson Orchestrate:

1. Ensure the YAML and Python files are in the correct location
2. Use the Orchestrate CLI to deploy the agent:
   ```bash
   orchestrate agents deploy --dir /path/to/viewpoint_discovery_agent
   ```
3. Start a chat session with the agent:
   ```bash
   orchestrate chat start --agent ViewpointDiscoveryAgent
   ```
